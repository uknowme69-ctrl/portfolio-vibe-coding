About This Project
This project is a single-page portfolio website built from scratch using modern front-end technologies. The goal was to create a professional, visually stunning, and memorable user experience that goes beyond a traditional static page. It features a sophisticated dark theme with gold accents and is packed with advanced animations and interactive elements to demonstrate a high level of proficiency in both design and development.

Key Features
Interactive Particle Background: A dynamic canvas animation featuring particles that connect and react to the user's mouse movements, creating a high-tech and immersive feel.

GSAP-Powered Scroll Animations: Utilizes the industry-standard GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) for high-performance animations:

Vertical Stacking Projects: A professional "sticky stacking" animation where project cards slide up and lock into place as the user scrolls.

Hero Text Reveal: An engaging entrance animation for the main headline text.

Fade-in Sections: Content sections elegantly fade and slide into view as they enter the viewport.

Magnetic UI Elements: Navigation links and buttons have a subtle "magnetic" pull towards the cursor, enhancing user interaction and adding a premium feel.

Animated Skills Showcase: Skill bars animate from 0% to their specified proficiency level when they become visible, providing a dynamic visual representation of my capabilities.

Professional, Multi-Font Design: A clean and highly readable font (Montserrat) for body text is paired with a unique, stylish font (Righteous) for branding to create a strong visual hierarchy.

Fully Responsive: While designed with modern desktops in mind, the layout is fluid and adaptable to various screen sizes.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the core structure and semantic markup of the website.

CSS3:

Custom Properties (Variables): For a clean, maintainable, and easily themeable color palette.

Flexbox & Grid: For modern, responsive layouts.

Glassmorphism Effect: Used on the project and contact cards for a stylish, layered look.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all interactivity, animations, and dynamic content.

Tailwind CSS: For utility-first styling to rapidly build the user interface.

GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): For all major, high-performance scroll-based and interactive animations.
